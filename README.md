# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Inspiration

   Corn clicker. The part of his project that I took insporation from is when the player hovers over the corn to click(main button), it displays a message. They also have it for their upgrade buttons. My upgrade buttons display the messages all the time. He uses a button title to display these messages. I did it a way that took a little longer unfortutantely. However this small detail adds a polished game feel.

   I liked that this one had a simple animation that added such a more satisfying feeling when clicking the object. Defiently had to steal this idea, I dont know how I didn't think of this. Amazing job from both of these people!
